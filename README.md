Word Detectives' Rules:



Players:

Two teams (red and blue), each with a Chief and Detectives.



Goal:

Be the first team to identify all your team’s secret words on the board.



Setup
A 5×5 grid of 25 word cards is laid out.
A key card (visible only to the Chief) shows which words belong to the red team, blue team, neutral, and one failure word.



Key card
A team is randomly selected to start. The starting team has 9 target words on the key card, the second team has 8 target words on their key card, there is one failure and the rest are neutral. The key card is applied the same to both teams.



Gameplay



Chief's turn:

Gives a one-word clue and a number.
The clue relates to one or more of their team’s words.

The clue cannot contain one of the words or be a rhyming word.



Example: “Ocean, 2” (hinting at two ocean-related words).



Detective’s turn:
Guess words one by one.

After each guess, the Chief reveals the word’s color.
They can make up to the number given + 1 guesses.
Turn ends if they guess a neutral, an opposing word, or the failure (which immediately ends the game in a loss).



Winning
The first team to find all their words wins.
If a team guesses the failure, they lose immediately.
